WebRTC :- WebRTC (Web real time communication) is a free, open-source project that provides web browsers 
          and mobile applications with the ability to stream audio, video, offline audio and videos and data in 
          real-time through peer-to-peer (P2P) connections.

* It is UDP based, data are sent in packets and packets might gets lost but that's ok there will be little jitter
  and further communication proceeds.


* P2P (peer-to-peer) :- P2P connection means you don't need a server, you can directly talk to each other.
                       Eg:- If two person are on video call, one send video to another's browser and vice versa.
The problem with P2P is if you have a big call like 5-10 peoples. one will have to send video or audio to (n-1) users
and same goes for incoming. One's incoming and outgoing bandwitdth is going to screwed.

* If there are only two people go with WebRTC.
